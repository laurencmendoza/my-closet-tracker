# Wear It Out
'Wear It Out' is a full-stack, full CRUD application that will allow a user to log all of their clothing items, as well as track their outfits. Users can add a clothing item to their virtual closet, and then create outfits from their clothing items. Then, users can create an entry for each day to track their outfits.
