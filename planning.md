# My Closet Tracker Planning
My Closet Tracker allows you to log all of your clothing items, and track your outfits. While viewing your clothing items, see how many times you've worn that item. Create outfits with your saved clothing items, and each day, log the outfits you've worn. You can view the outfits you've worn on past days, and save your favorite outfits to use as inspiration for future occasions.
